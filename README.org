* Warfare
/A library for creating Discord Bots in Common Lisp./

** WARNING
Warfare is /extremely new/. It's currently in development, and just
barely getting its footing. The current goal is to get basic HTTP
interactions going, and then be able to establish a connection to, and
subsequently communicate over, the Gateway.
